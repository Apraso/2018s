# Rust setup

This guide demonstrates how to install/setup Rust and its related programs for your development environment. Only follow this guide for local installation to either OS X, Ubuntu 16.04, or Bash on Ubuntu on Windows.

## 1. Install the binaries

You will install the Rust toolchain, which includes Cargo, the package manager for Rust.

On any platform, run:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

And follow the instructions. That’s it! You’ll install packages as a part of the assignment.
